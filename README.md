# In-Context-Learning-ICL-and-Prompt-Tuning
Official code for *How Does In-Context Learning Help Prompt Tuning?*, exploring how in-context learning (ICL) enhances prompt tuning in few-shot NLP tasks. This repository includes model setup, dataset preprocessing, and training configurations to support reproducibility and further experimentation
This experiment investigates the effectiveness of in-context learning (ICL) techniques for prompt tuning using the T5 model architecture. The primary objective is to assess how incorporating learnable prompt embeddings enhances the model's performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including:

1. **Question Answering (QA)**: Utilizing the SQuAD dataset to evaluate the model's ability to provide accurate answers based on provided questions.
2. **Natural Language Inference (NLI)**: Using the MultiNLI dataset to determine how well the model can predict the relationship between premises and hypotheses.
3. **Question Classification**: Applying the TREC dataset to classify questions into predefined categories.

### Methodology

- **Model Selection**: The T5 large model is chosen for its versatility and capability in handling multiple NLP tasks.
- **Prompt Tuning**: The model's input embeddings are extended with learnable prompt embeddings to facilitate improved contextual understanding during inference.
- **Dataset Preparation**: Each dataset is preprocessed to include in-context learning examples, allowing the model to leverage prior examples while making predictions.
- **Training Configuration**: Detailed training arguments are defined for optimizing the model's performance throughout the experiments.

### Expected Outcomes

We anticipate that the integration of in-context learning through prompt tuning will lead to enhanced model performance, as measured by standard evaluation metrics across the selected NLP tasks. The findings from this experiment could provide insights into the efficacy of ICL in improving the adaptability and robustness of transformer-based models in various contexts.
